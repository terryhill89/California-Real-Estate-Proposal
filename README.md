# California Real Estate Proposal

## Overview:

Real estate is a significant asset class, with investments ranging from residential properties to commercial buildings, industrial facilities, and undeveloped land. The real estate market is dynamic and impacted by factors such as economic conditions, demographics, and government policies. With the increase in interest rate and house prices, an analysis of real estate market will highlight school and neighborhood characteristics across the state of California.
